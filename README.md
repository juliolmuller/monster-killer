Frontend web application developed to apply knowledge in Vue.js (non-CLI structure). This project was proposed and developed in [Cod3r's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-js-completo/), very nice and recommended. It is a single-player game to fight a monster using different hits with random effects.
